nbody_mpi
=========

MPI parallelization of Piet Hut's nbody_sh1.

Original (was?) available at https://www.ias.edu/exids/starter-code-n-body-simulations
This is ready to compile and run on your Raspberry Pi cluster. But it will be slow.
The code may scale on 4 nodes with 400 bodies or more.
